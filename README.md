This repository demonstrates a subtle but common error in PHP: the silent handling of accessing non-existent array keys.  The `bug.php` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected version with robust error handling.  This silent failure can lead to difficult-to-debug issues in applications, and highlights the importance of defensive programming practices in PHP.
