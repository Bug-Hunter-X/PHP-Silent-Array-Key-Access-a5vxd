In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys.  Consider this code:

```php
<?php
$myArray = array('a' => 1, 'b' => 2, 'c' => 3);

if (isset($myArray['d'])) {
    echo "Key 'd' exists";
} else {
    echo "Key 'd' does not exist";
}

//Attempt to access a non-existent key
echo $myArray['d'];
?>
```

The `isset()` check correctly determines that the key 'd' is absent. However, attempting to directly access `$myArray['d']` without proper error handling will not throw a traditional error. Instead, PHP will silently return an empty string or null, which might lead to unexpected behavior further down the line, and make it difficult to debug.
